Titanic Survival Prediction - XGBoost Model
Project Overview
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset, utilizing an XGBoost classifier to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.

Data Preprocessing
Missing Data: Missing values in Age and Fare were imputed with the mean of the respective columns.
Feature Selection: The features used in the model include Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.
Encoding: Categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
Scaling: Numerical features were normalized using StandardScaler to standardize the data.
Model
The model used for this classification task is XGBoost (XGBClassifier), which was trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%.
Accuracy: The model achieved a satisfactory accuracy on the test set.
File Descriptions
train.csv: Training data used to build the model.
test.csv: Test data for which survival predictions are generated.
submission.csv: Output file containing PassengerId and predicted Survived values, formatted for submission.
Instructions to Run
